-----------------CHAPTER-0----------------
42      Karl decided not to share the burden with
44  anyone else. He hoped he'd somehow manage to
49  bear it, that he'd get to the bottom of this slow
48  atrophy of reality... and maybe even prevent it.
41  He visited a succession of scientists and
34  delved into conspiracy theories...
 0  
41      Meanwhile, the streets grew deserted and
46  the urban infrastructure disappeared. Even the
44  topographical features of the land sank into
46  oblivion, one after another. Hills, lakes, the
46  nearby forest. Those people who still remained
44  had no idea that what was around them was no
46  more than a wretched stub of reality. In fact,
46  that was what triggered the greatest terror in
48  Karl. He was like someone who was afflicted with
44  Alzheimer's disease and sinking into an ever
--------------------
44  more profound depression, yet the difference
43  here was that it wasn't memory after memory
49  which was vanishing... here, it was element after
21  element of the world.
 0  
39      He thought of his parents with growing
47  frequency, particularly of his father. We don't
44  recollect a much-loved person who is dead as
41  they were in their prime, in their youth,
50  burgeoning with life and health. We'd like to, but
48  that's not how it works. If we were with someone
48  like that to the end, then we'll always remember
47  them as weak, shrunk by disease or by age... or
49  by both..., incapable of performing even the most
38  straightforward of activities unaided.
 0  
37      And that's when we're lucky. Because
--------------------
43  sometimes we don't even recall our deceased
48  nearest and dearest as they were in life at all.
46  For if it so happens that we're there at their
49  death, then that crushing sight will stay with us
40  for ever and it overpowers, conquers and
46  smothers the earlier, good and happy memories.
 0  
41      They say that the warriors of yore would
49  rather die on the field of battle than of old age
38  in their beds. This is ascribed to the
46  categories of heroism and courage. Karl didn't
45  believe it had anything to do with either the
41  one or the other. On the contrary. They'd
44  simply known all too well which was the more
51  dreadful... to die, infirm and decrepit, of old age
47  or suddenly, in battle. So this had by no means
36  been heroism, but a _d_e _f_a_c_t_o escape.
--------------------
 0  
44      He'd always wondered whether, if he were to
40  meet a sudden death, in an accident, for
49  instance, he'd die with a cry of 'Oh, God!' or of
50  'Fucking hell!' However, once he'd finally decided
44  that he was going to go out on his own terms
44  and avail himself of the 9 mm Luger P08 that
46  had been in their family for generations... it
43  turned out that [A] he went without a single
 5  word.

37      "What're you reading?" Judith asked,
27  bustling around the house. 
 0  
41      Karl had no wish to get into an argument
48  this time. As he got older, he found it more and
45  more wearing. He decided not to batter at the
33  problem, but rather to avoid it. 
 0  
42      "A book," he muttered, gathering together
46  the shreds of his patience in order to use the
27  most neutral tone possible.
 0  
46      "What's it called, that beloved literature of
30  yours? Begins with an 'f'...?"
 0  
43      "Science fiction," he replied resignedly. 
 0  
--------------------
47      "I knew it was some kind of fickly-fiddle-dee-
 5  dee."
 0  
44      '...ignore it ignore it ignore it ignore it
47  ignore it...,' he repeated without pause in his
43  thoughts, like a mantra. He recognised that
42  she'd asked out of spite. After all, their
43  relationship hadn't just begun today, so of
40  course she already knew the answer. This
47  wasn't the first time they'd had a conversation
13  on the topic.
 0  
45      They'd been going through a difficult period
42  recently and only the day before he'd been
44  wondering whether or not to end it with her.
47  However, he'd assumed he still loved her, since
45  he liked to sit with her sometimes and simply
--------------------
47  indulge in doing nothing at all. He couldn't do
47  that with anyone else. Even so, she quite often
47  drove him mad. He did acknowledge, though, that
36  love isn't like a rock, enduring and
49  everlastingly constant, but is more like a plant;
48  it requires attention, nurture and care. So he'd
29  decided to play the gardener.
 0  
45      Judith is a biblical name. The Old Testament
46  Judith of Bethulia was described as a woman of
43  exceeding beauty and great riches, but very
45  religious at the same time. When the Assyrian
44  army attacked Israel, the highest commander,
51  Holofernes, laid siege to the city of Bethulia. All
46  seemed to be lost, but Judith decided that she
40  alone would defend the entire city. That
44  evening, she prayed and then set out for the
--------------------
42  Assyrian camp, carrying only a bag holding
44  some morsels of food and drink. She told the
45  guards that she was fleeing the besieged city
46  to save her life. When one of them brought her
44  into Holofernes' presence, the commander was
40  immediately enamoured of the deceptively
51  beautiful... and just as deceptively defenceless...
40  woman and gave orders to his servants to
41  attend on her. Holofernes planned to take
48  Judith on the fourth day. To that end, he held a
44  great banquet and, while the feasting was in
39  progress, he urged her to drink copious
49  amounts of wine. Yet, so inflamed was he that, in
41  the end, it was he who drank himself into
35  unconsciousness. Judith seized this
44  opportunity... and taking up Holofernes' own
47  sword, she cut off his head. Then she put it in
--------------------
44  the bag which had held her food and returned
47  to Bethulia. The next day, the commander's head
45  was hung from the walls of the besieged city.
43  When the Assyrians saw it and realised what
44  had happened... what that "one Hebrew woman"
48  was capable of... they were seized with fear and
46  they fled. At that, the Israelites took off in
41  pursuit of the enemy's troops and crushed
 5  them.
 0  
44      Karl had a justified suspicion that his own
43  Judith was very familiar with this cheerful
49  story, since time and again she'd said to him "if
45  you piss me off, [A] I'll cut off your fucking
 6  head".

-----------------CHAPTER-2----------------
44      Karl preferred to avoid decapitation but, a
45  few days later, something in particular began
47  nagging at his thoughts. As follows; a painting
46  had always hung on the wall in the guest room.
46  A few smears of red on a yellow background, an
49  object which Judith grandiloquently called 'art'.
39  It had hung there... until the previous
44  Wednesday. Since then, the wall had remained
 6  empty.
 0  
47      Karl didn't miss the 'work of art', but it had
47  to be admitted that the daub did have a certain
45  market value. Besides this, he was astonished
44  that not so much as a trace had been left on
47  the wall. The picture had hung there for years,
44  so there really ought to be a large, lighter
23  patch. It was most odd.
--------------------
 0  
44      He weighed up his options. Should he [A] ask
46  Judith about it, risking yet another clash, or
49  would it be better to wait until the next day and
47  [B] talk it over with his brother? Perhaps Anton
30  would know something about it.

-----------------CHAPTER-3----------------
45      "I don't understand you at all," Judith said
47  irritably. "Sometimes you say you're good at it
48  and other times you complain that your writing's
34  a waste of space. It's senseless."
 0  
44      Karl was sitting at the table by the window
41  and gazing out, idly watching their obese
42  neighbour from the house opposite. She was
42  trying to catch her Yorkshire terrier and,
44  given the shape she was in, her efforts were
47  commendable. However, her miniature pet had the
44  urge to enjoy a taste of freedom and, at the
35  same time, it was remarkably agile.
 0  
45      "There's nothing contradictory about it," he
41  said contemptuously. "I write poorly, but
46  everyone else is considerably worse than I am.
--------------------
48  In fact, that's what sickens me. The books sell,
48  so apparently I'm good, though the truth is that
30  it's none of my doing at all."
 0  
40      "Arrogant arsehole!" Judith's anger was
39  unfeigned. "You wouldn't recognise good
48  literature even if it stripped off its thong and
18  sat on your face!"
 0  
43      Karl recognised that this was an excellent
27  moment to change the topic.
 0  
38      "Listen, I've been meaning to ask you
40  something all day. What happened to your
42  beloved daub that used to hang on the wall
 7  there?"
 0  
--------------------
34      Judith looked at him in surprise.
 0  
43      "What daub? That wall's never had anything
15  hanging on it."
 0  
35      Karl was so astonished that he had
34  absolutely no idea how to respond.
 0  
36      The sound of a car horn blared out,
47  followed by the squeal of tyres... and one more
47  squeal... of pain and terror... almost drowning
48  out the first. The Yorkie had run straight under
33  the wheels of an approaching car.
 0  
28      Karl got up from the table.
 0  
47      "I'm going upstairs," he remarked. "Maybe I'll
--------------------
34  manage to get a bit of work done."
 0  
40      [A] He'd always preferred happy endings.

-----------------CHAPTER-4----------------
40      The following day, Karl was contentedly
50  taking part in a traditional drinking session with
44  his brother. He was planning to question him
49  about the 'vanishing painting' while they were at
44  it, although he didn't quite know why it was
22  bothering him so much.
 0  
44      They were sitting on the veranda of Anton's
40  house in the suburbs and sipping cognac.
 0  
44      "The difference between pate with bacon and
43  bacon with pate needs settling once and for
 5  all."
 0  
14      "Top 'em up."
 0  
42      During one of the top-ups, Karl turned to
--------------------
48  the topic of the 'daub', describing it in a fair
17  amount of detail.
 0  
47      "But... what painting?" Anton looked genuinely
47  surprised. "No, I don't remember any picture. I
49  mean, I wouldn't forget a monstrosity like that."
 0  
37      The moment of conversation left Karl
21  completely confused. 
 0  
40      "I'm at an utter loss to understand how
45  that's possible." He mused for a moment, then
43  continued, speaking partly to himself. "I'm
45  certain we've even got some photos of a party
42  at our place somewhere and you can see the
45  wall with that picture on it in them. This is
47  probably the strangest thing that's happened to
--------------------
47  me recently. Exactly like an antithesis to _d_e_j_a
39  _v_u". He took a large swig of his drink.
43  "Something was there and it's gone... Maybe
48  space-time is collapsing," he said with a laugh.
 0  
42      "I don't know what you're muttering about
49  there." Anton wasn't convinced. "Time is time, it
41  runs linearly. We see that every day," he
38  added, topping their glasses up again.
 0  
47      "That's not necessarily the case. Not at all."
44  Karl spoke calmly, even though his brother's
49  irritated resistance was beginning to make itself
49  felt... and so was the cognac he'd already drunk.
46  It was going to his head with a vengeance now.
42  "It could be a bit like the sun. How do we
49  perceive it? Because of our limitations, it seems
--------------------
43  to us that the sun moves in relation to the
48  earth... that it travels from east to west, even
42  though that's not what happens at all. And
46  maybe humans' limited perception also triggers
49  the impression of the linearity of time, whereas,
49  in fact, it might be a random collection of small
48  fragments, for instance, like a mirror shattered
44  into myriad shards, with each one containing
45  the reflection of a part of reality. When the
45  shards are similar to one another, that might
43  be exactly where the impression of _d__j_ _v_u,
40  comes from, for example, or an automatic
44  aversion or attraction to someone we've just
32  met... or my 'anti-_d_e_j_a_-_v_u'..." 
 0  
22      He smiled to himself.
 0  
--------------------
45      "My God, you have to give up drinking," said
47  Anton. "But from tomorrow." [A] And for now, top
 7  'em up.

-----------------CHAPTER-5----------------
43      The following day, Karl had little time to
40  ponder over 'the affair of the vanishing
44  masterpiece', since he had to devote himself
46  entirely to work. The publisher's deadline was
44  closing in and his book was still a long way
43  from being finished. Finally, he decided to
46  present the publisher with a typewritten draft
46  version in order to be able to prove that he'd
47  undertaken some kind of activity with a view to
48  fulfilling his contract. In general, he tried to
40  behave honestly, not so much to meet the
43  demands of his conscience, but more for the
45  comfortable sense of being superior to others
46  that it gave him. But, as he always said, "All
44  those who are honest live short, impecunious
47  lives, without the respect of their nearest and
40  dearest," adding, after a customary, and
--------------------
45  effective pause, "Short... if they're lucky."
 0  
42      He decided to go for a stroll through the
43  town centre, a notion the sunny weather was
46  conducive to. On such occasions, he was in the
46  habit of eavesdropping on the conversations of
38  passers-by. He found the sentences and
44  phrases torn from their context fascinating.
 0  
41      "They came up with these smartphones," a
44  guy said feverishly to his corpulent friend,
44  "and people don't delete their text messages
35  any more. They often save the whole
46  correspondence... I checked recently and, over
48  the course of the entire relationship, she and I
41  exchanged exactly seven hundred messages.
42  Shit! A fucking seven-hundred-text-message
--------------------
 9  romance!"
 0  
39      "...don't talk rubbish. Representative
42  democracy is like representative eating or
39  having representative sex," a handsome,
43  middle-aged blonde woman declaimed into her
45  phone. "No. Absolutely not! You might just as
49  well say that, if we're going to eliminate global
46  warming, then we need to turn on more fridges,
42  because then it'll get colder. Idiot!" She
46  laughed, clearly amused by the reaction of the
36  person on the other end of the call.
 0  
38      Karl made his way unhurriedly along a
42  street lined with buildings on both sides,
47  savouring the crisp morning and listening in on
40  the products of the randomly encountered
--------------------
41  human minds. However, there came a moment
45  when he noticed that something was wrong. The
42  row of buildings to either side of him had
45  unexpectedly stopped; on the spot where, only
41  the day before, one of the town's largest
41  shopping centres had stood, there was now
36  nothing but an empty, grassy square.
 0  
38      He started running from side to side,
47  searching for a sign, any sign, of the previous
46  day's presence of the building. Nothing. Not a
47  trace. In the initial impulse of the moment, he
41  wanted to ask the first passer-by he came
41  across about the phenomenon, but for some
43  unfathomable reason he had a clear sense of
47  what he would hear in reply. In the end, he got
50  himself under control. After all, he couldn't just
--------------------
40  stand there on the smooth lawn for ever.
 0  
45      "Excuse me..." The hot-dog seller stood here
46  every day, on the other side of the street. He
42  must have seen what had happened. "Where's
43  the shopping centre gone? Have they carried
48  out some kind of controlled demolition? But this
32  fast...? Where's the rubble...?"
 0  
45      The hot-dog seller gazed at him with growing
47  astonishment and animosity. He clearly had Karl
17  down as a madman.
 0  
39      "Come on, mate, there ain't never been
47  nuffink like that 'ere, not in all the fourteen
48  years I been workin' this patch. Get outta here,
33  you're scarin' me customers off!"
--------------------
 0  
46      Once his first attack of panic had retreated,
46  Karl realised that the time had come to make a
47  decision. What next? How was he going to handle
46  what was happening? What attitude was he going
41  to take to these events? He could see two
45  options; admit that he was, in fact, probably
45  insane and [A] see a psychiatrist or recognise
46  that, actually, something bad really was going
39  on and [B] try to get some advice from a
10  scientist.

Lines: 96, max 96

-----------------CHAPTER-6----------------
45      While he was waiting for his turn to go into
48  the psychiatrist's office, Karl felt impelled to
40  have a cigarette. His feelings about the
47  addiction were mixed, given that his father had
43  died of cancer. 'What's interesting is that
43  Father never smoked, but cancer did for him
47  anyway, so actually, what would be the sense in
45  avoiding tobacco," he mused, reaching for the
43  packet of Gauloises he kept tucked away for
22  just such an occasion.
 0  
39      His father had battled with cancer for
49  years, enjoying a relatively comfortable life. It
46  was only in the final months that his body was
43  suddenly ravaged; _d_e _f_a_c_t_o, the disease had
46  rendered him bedridden in the space of a week.
46  Karl had cared for him to the very end, but it
--------------------
44  was in precisely that period that the two of
42  them had found it difficult to establish a
45  conversation of any length. Even during their
44  shorter exchanges they had tried not to look
45  at each other, but had gazed somewhere off to
45  the side, as if the slow process of dying had
45  pushed them both in a state of embarrassment.
 0  
45      Karl's train of thought was interrupted when
44  he was invited to go into the office. Doctor
44  Nadia Morozova was standing with her back to
39  the door and didn't notice that he been
49  admitted. Karl watched her in silence for a while
47  as she straightened the seams of her stockings.
45  They'd known each other for years and there'd
45  even been a time when a deeper connection had
46  run between them. That was nothing but history
--------------------
48  now, though. In a long-term relationship, people
39  can begin to feel an aversion for their
44  partner, frequently accusing them of a great
40  many inconsequential things, quite often
48  completely unjustly. This happens because it's a
49  way that lovers attempt to hide the fact that, in
46  reality, they are angry with themselves for no
47  longer being able to perceive that _s_o_m_e_t_h_i_n_g in
47  their partner which other people can still see.
39  In other words, putting it plainly, the
46  dog-in-the-manger syndrome raises its head. It
47  might be that Karl and Nadia were both aware of
47  this, since what remained of their relationship
39  was a kind of trust, if not friendship.
 0  
39      In general, he did the talking and she
44  allowed him to open up and, so far, this had
--------------------
16  worked for them.
 0  
41      She heard him out and then thought for a
 7  moment.
 0  
43      "Nonetheless, you decided to bring this to
 6  me..."
 0  
44      "You know how it goes. Talk to the wise and
39  stay silent with the fools." He smiled.
 0  
38      "So. You think you have a psychiatric
40  disorder? I need to know what your inner
46  attitude is to what's happened to you. Are you
35  aware that it's completely unreal?"
 0  
48      "Are you asking if I'm a lunatic? I don't know.
--------------------
45  I thought producing a diagnosis like that was
40  more your role." Karl laughed nervously.
45  "There was a time when I gave some thought to
39  this... if continually interpreting and
49  fictionalising is a trait of the human mind, then
44  dreams can only be attempts to interpret and
42  fictionalise a process that has _n_o_t_h_i_n_g in
47  common with the actual experiencing of reality;
47  the processing of the data collected during the
47  day. I assume that, then, the mind makes use of
47  the most distant associations possible so as to
44  somehow bring processes diametrically remote
46  from the brain's 'daytime' workings, processes
46  that are more reminiscent of a computer's data
44  processing operations than the workings of a
48  conscious mind, into line with familiar reality.
43  You understand what I mean. An example of a
--------------------
45  close association; the doorbell rings and, at
44  that moment, the sleeping person dreams that
46  someone's ringing the doorbell, that they come
49  in, _e_t_c_e_t_e_r_a. I'd say that all of us are familiar
46  with a phenomenon like that. The sleeping mind
44  reacts to a stimulus from the outside world.
50  What I have in mind here is that if, in the dream,
46  the doorbell was transformed into the sound of
49  a church bell or a falling glass, I'd also accept
29  that as a close association."
 0  
37      "What does that have to do with your
24  condition?" Nadia asked.
 0  
38      "I have the impression that a similar
45  phenomenon could occur during a psychological
45  illness; the damaged mind is carrying out the
--------------------
46  strangest, most reckless and even, more likely
48  than not, completely nonsensical operations, but
50  some part of it is still striving to interpret and
48  fictionalise them by using mechanisms similar to
47  the ones that come into play during sleep. Such
44  intensive work deprives the mind of both the
50  possibility and the time for contact with reality,
45  so there's either almost no contact or, quite
50  simply, zero contact. The most distant... or, more
44  rarely, slightly closer... associations then
41  become the basic principle for the mind's
50  activity, the sick person's route, in its own way,
47  to the exterior world, but, at one and the same
47  time, the therapist's route... or key... to the
47  patient's interior world. However, I think that
43  using that one route to reach the contorted
48  mind would either be a singularly difficult task
--------------------
46  or, quite simply, an impossible one, because a
40  person with a mind that's working in the
47  classical way is incapable of comprehending the
45  trains of associative thought followed by the
47  sick mind. In my opinion, a healthy person only
48  uses them when they're asleep, while we all make
44  use of nothing but 'close' associations when
13  we're awake."

44      Nadia jotted something down in the notebook
18  lying on her desk.
 0  
36      "In that case, what are the distant
45  associations like?" she asked a moment later.
 0  
40      "The difference here is so great that I
45  wouldn't even be able to give an example of a
--------------------
44  distant association, because only one of its
44  outer limits is located in the reality we're
46  really familiar with. The other, after all, is
50  situated in the unimaginable world of insanity. In
41  other words, close associations are those
40  where both extremities are rooted in our
41  reality, where the principle of relevance
35  applies... we use a few of the most
43  characteristic features of an object in our
47  associations. I don't think the more remote and
41  distant associations are grounded in that
47  principle. Forced to fictionalise elements that
43  are diametrically removed from reality, the
44  sleeping or sick mind latches on to randomly
47  selected features, almost like someone drowning
50  clutches at a straw. It doesn't in the least seize
43  on those that are most typical. Because the
--------------------
41  things it's forced to associate with have
39  nothing, or almost nothing, in common."
 0  
41      "Well, I think you should take this to a
44  psychiatrist you haven't fucked yet," Madame
43  Doctor retorted in a professional tone. She
46  prescribed the patient some pills, recommended
48  a month without reading science fiction and then
43  ordered him to get out and come back if his
18  problems recurred.
 0  
40      Karl had got as far as the door when he
34  turned back to say one more thing.
 0  
14      "Nadia, I..."
 0  
42      He froze on the spot. He was alone in the
--------------------
45  office. Nadia had vanished. The furniture had
39  vanished. The fixtures and fittings had
43  vanished. The room was completely empty. He
48  rushed out into the waiting room... and into the
49  same situation. Bare walls and not a living soul.
 0  
45      Terrified, Karl [A] raced out of the building
20  and into the street.

Lines: 178, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-7----------------
36      Karl couldn't believe that what was
46  happening was nothing more than the product of
47  his brain. Fortunately, the fact that he earned
48  a living writing sci-fi meant that he was fairly
47  well acquainted with several scholars in fields
39  such as physics and maths, since they'd
45  performed the role of official consultants on
44  his books from time to time. One of them was
44  Doctor Einarsson and he was the man Karl was
42  now heading to see. Marching along with an
45  energetic step, he wondered what would happen
47  if, in addition to objects, people also started
49  vanishing. Judith... The mere tentative heralding
30  of that thought terrified him.
 0  
46      He wasn't, perhaps, all that much of a family
46  man. On more than one occasion, his father had
--------------------
46  said that he'd always taken care of his family
43  and never thrown money away on drink, cards
42  and whores. Yet, as he'd said it, what had
43  echoed in his voice was more akin to regret
47  than pride. Moreover, Karl believed that even a
45  great many items of everyday use were capable
35  of lasting longer than a modern-day
46  relationship between a man and a woman. Stereo
43  equipment. Shoes. Nivea cream. Within a few
45  years, things would probably have reached the
40  point where even fresh yogurt would last
48  longer. Despite this, Karl was hoping that, this
50  time, this was the genuine article. His family. He
46  didn't even want to think that something might
17  happen to Judith.
 0  
46      Doctor Einarsson wasn't all that old, but the
--------------------
44  degree of abnegation and neglected seediness
48  he'd attained meant that Karl had the impression
44  he was communing with a man well advanced in
43  years... and one who was both malicious and
48  aggravatingly acute, at that. He listened to the
43  entire story and then sank into an enormous
39  armchair upholstered in plush which had
43  undoubtedly been red many years previously.
 0  
41      Finally, he spoke. "So, you believe that
41  objects of various sizes are unexpectedly
46  vanishing along with human memory of them," he
47  said slowly, tugging on a shaggy, greying beard
47  adorning the vicinity of lips stained yellow by
45  way of kilograms of tobacco smoked and litres
16  of coffee drunk.
 0  
--------------------
28      "I'm... I'm just asking..."
 0  
42      "A steaming pile of fucking horseshit can
45  also occur in the interrogative," the scholar
20  interrupted sharply.
 0  
42      Karl had known him for years and was well
45  aware of the fact that it was sometimes worth
47  showing him a certain degree of patience. So he
49  kept quiet and, after a moment, Einarsson did, in
30  fact, pick up the topic again.
 0  
40      "Some physicists believe that the whole
43  universe and everything we experience every
48  day is only a holographic reflection of physical
37  processes taking place somewhere else
47  entirely... in a distant, two-dimensional space
--------------------
35  that's primal in relation to ours."
 0  
42      "All right, but what does that have to do
43  with my situation?" Despite his hold on his
46  patience, Karl was beginning to get irritated.
48  "Scientists announce their highfalutin theories,
48  but I'm more interested in what the implications
43  arising from them are for everyday life and
44  ordinary people. What the hell does hologram
45  theory or Plato's bloody cave have to do with
44  the phenomena that have occurred recently? I
40  don't give a damn about deliberations or
46  whether, when I wipe my backside, the original
38  me in the original world is wiping his
46  two-dimensional original of my rounded behind,
47  or whether his arse is more real than mine is!"
 0  
--------------------
29      Einarsson smiled to himself.
 0  
45      "The reflections can often be imprecise," he
44  remarked. "They can contain defects. Anyway,
48  it's always fascinated me how suspiciously close
46  the ancient thinkers were to modern science...
48  and sometimes even to the truth in itself. Let's
47  take... Democritus of Andera, who developed his
44  atomic theory of the world before Christ was
42  ever born... Anaximander, who admitted the
40  existence of numerous worlds emerging in
38  parallel in the _a_p_e_i_r_o_n... in a manner
46  disturbingly close to modern research into the
44  laws of quantum physics, which indicate that
48  they not only exist in parallel to our universe,
46  but exert a mutual influence on each other, as
47  well. I sometimes have the impression that they
--------------------
47  weren't pioneers, but rather reality was slowly
39  adapting itself to our imaginations and
49  expectations... that we're laboriously carving it
48  out with our own minds... Maybe Earth really was
32  flat thousands of years ago...?"
 0  
41      He broke off and rummaged noisily around
44  the room in the ensuing pause before finally
40  succeeded in his quest to light a small,
47  blackened pipe. When he continued, his face was
32  almost entirely veiled in smoke.
 0  
45      "Even if what you've said were true, there's
45  no way I could be of help to you. In order to
46  draw the correct conclusions, I'd have to make
42  a thorough analysis of the changes as they
49  occur, and they... as you maintain... don't exist
--------------------
47  from my point of view. So, besides the question
46  'What the hell is going on,' there remains one
46  more key question. Why are you the only person
33  who can perceive the phenomenon?"
 0  
39      Karl was receiving the impression that
49  Einarsson didn't believe him. Maybe the scientist
46  thought that the questions he'd brought to him
41  actually related to another sci-fi novel?
48  Nonetheless, he'd proven helpful in one respect.
46  Yes, indeed, it was most odd. Setting insanity
42  aside... for what reason was Karl the only
42  conscious observer of the events that were
13  taking place?
 0  
47      Turning that thought over in his mind... [A] he
13  set off home.
--------------------

Lines: 136, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-8----------------
32      On the way home, he studied his
45  surroundings intently; he had an overpowering
46  impression that there were fewer people around
44  than usual. Inwardly, he was counting on the
48  fact that it only seemed that way to him. He was
45  also seriously concerned about Judith's fate.
43  Would he find her at home when he got back?
47  What did it matter that she sometimes irritated
41  him? Perhaps recent events had opened his
45  eyes but, be that as it may, he now knew that
46  he'd certainly never meet anyone else like her
46  again. Besides, he recognised that a bit of an
43  intellectual set-to got the blood flowing. 
 0  
44      "Just let her be safe and sound, God..." he
42  thought in terror as he slowly grasped the
46  door handle. "God, help me... and if you don't
--------------------
47  exist, that'd be out-and-out shittiness on your
 6  part."
 0  
43      "Ah! Here you are!" Judith opened the door
49  to him; she'd heard him fumbling ineffectively at
47  the lock. "I was beginning to wonder what you'd
17  got sucked into."
 0  
45      Karl wouldn't have been able to describe the
49  relief he felt even if he'd tried. But he didn't.
45  He simply pulled Judith to him and hugged her
20  as hard as he could.
 0  
42      "You're suffocating me, you lunatic!" She
49  laughed. "I'm glad to see you, too. Come on, come
12  inside now."
 0  
--------------------
42      Over the next few days, Karl got over his
47  recent trying experiences and did his utmost to
40  forget about the strange events and live
42  normally. To make the most of what he had.
46  Previously, he probably hadn't really realised
44  just how important his home, his work on his
43  succession of books, his conversations with
44  Judith and at times, even his arguments with
17  her, were to him.
 0  
42      Judith sometimes questioned him about his
19  pursuit of fiction.
 0  
36      "Why do you actually need to create
46  different stories? And when you're not writing
39  anything, then you're reading again, or
51  watching a whole heap of films, serials, series...?
--------------------
29  Is it some kind of escapism?"
 0  
42      Karl's reply would invariably involve the
17  same explanation.
 0  
45      "I simply believe that life's too short. The
42  awareness of inevitable death generates an
41  imperative in me to prolong life by every
47  possible means. Even if it's only an ostensible
45  prolongment. Writing and reading and watching
47  are the ways I absorb other people's lives, the
48  fictional and the possible alike. Every story is
46  someone's life... and I can observe it, do you
42  see? I can experience it together with the
46  central character. I don't know what awaits me
48  after death... eternal nothingness, possibly. In
40  comparison to that, my one brief life is
--------------------
47  definitely not nearly enough. It's outrageously
47  inadequate. So fiction's my way of compensating
43  for my forthcoming non-existence. You never
36  know when the world's going to end."
 0  
42      Sometimes, that was enough to satisfy her
36  and she'd walk away, bored... as she
39  underscored with a smile... by 'the sad
49  bullshitting of an unfulfilled intellectual'. But
42  there were also times when she took up the
 6  topic.
 0  
44      "I think the same thing applies to history,
49  you know... as the knowledge of it in the making.
39  Look how much information we have that,
46  perhaps, we unconsciously treat as memories of
43  a kind. We know what happened in the Middle
--------------------
48  Ages, in antiquity... Thanks to reconstructions,
42  documentaries and, damn it, even thanks to
46  bullshit costume dramas and bodice rippers, we
43  have a kind of picture of what those people
45  looked like, of their customs and of how they
45  spoke. Knowledge of the standards of medicine
51  and hygiene of those times... and of the cuisine...
47  even enables us to imagine the smell of a given
49  era. We didn't live then, but we have a different
50  impression, because, after all, in this way, we're
46  'remembering' everything. When you think about
46  it... how vast our lives have become thanks to
35  that. How far they extend in time!"
 0  
48      "I agree. That's the first half of the problem.
43  Because, to use your description, we extend
44  our lives in both directions. Yes, we'd most
--------------------
42  certainly like to _h_a_v_e lived for ever, but
45  besides that, we'd also wish eternal life for
45  ourselves in the sense of living _f_r_o_m now for
49  all time. So, in mind, if not in body, we squeeze
45  ourselves as far as possible into the future.
48  Hence futurology. Hence sci-fi. They give us the
49  sense that we know what the world will be like in
48  the future... they 'extend' our lives 'forward'.
45  That's why I write. Even though hardly anyone
17  at all reads it."
 0  
40       "Don't exaggerate. I did see what they
41  wrote about that piece from several years
44  back, you know... that it's 'a cult novel'."
 0  
46      "It seems that, if you wait long enough, then
49  even shit will obtain a noble patina. Anyway, the
--------------------
49  flourishing of a so-called cult isn't so much the
43  upshot of either an author's efforts or the
44  quality of a work; it's more a result of the
32  activity of the readers' minds."
 0  
43      One day, Karl was looking through some old
43  documents, searching for his father's death
47  certificate, but it was nowhere to be found. He
47  phoned the register office which had issued it.
 0  
47      "I sorry, but I'm afraid I have no information
46  on the matter." The clerk's voice held an edge
49  of suspicion that Karl was sadly all too familiar
45  with now. "You must have the wrong branch. If
41  anything at all had been dealt with here,
39  there'd certainly be some trace of it."
 0  
--------------------
45      So, in the tenuous hope that it was, indeed,
45  a mistake, Karl phoned the hospital which had
40  issued the medical certificate of death.
 0  
42      "No. Unfortunately not." Listening to the
46  voice of the doctor on duty as it came through
47  the phone, Karl mechanically envisaged a short,
47  bald man. He started wondering if someone could
45  sound bald. "There are no notes at all and no
45  medical history. No one of that name has ever
28  been treated here. Goodbye."
 0  
44      After Karl had visited several other public
46  institutions, it became clear that neither his
46  father nor his mother had ever existed at all.
45  There was no record of them, no documentation
45  concerning them whatsoever. Karl felt that he
--------------------
48  couldn't bear this much longer, that he might do
47  himself some harm. The time had clearly come to
45  decide whether or not to involve someone else
47  in the matter. He knew he couldn't cope with it
47  alone any longer. He weighed it up in his mind.
44  Should he [A] tell his brother everything and
48  ask him to help? But maybe it would be better [B]
50  not to risk that...? You never know... maybe Anton
46  wouldn't believe him and would take the entire
39  story for a symptom of a serious mental
11  illness...?

Lines: 164, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-9----------------
45      Anton didn't utter a word for a long moment.
38  And then he stayed quiet a bit longer.
 0  
41      Finally, he spoke. "I don't know how I'm
42  supposed to respond to this. I mean, we've
44  always been orphans. Our parents' identities
24  were never established."
 0  
46      "That's absurd! They both lived to a ripe old
44  age!" Karl was having a serious problem with
47  staying calm. However, he did what he could not
47  to seem like a frenzied madman. "Father died of
40  cancer ten years ago, two days after his
20  eightieth birthday."
 0  
40      "Have you... have you got any photos of
49  them? Documents...? Bloody hell, man, anything at
--------------------
 6  all?!"
 0  
44      "No! That's exactly the problem! Everything
47  that's connected with an object that disappears
50  is also subject to utter disintegration, including
18  all memory of it."
 0  
36      "...but this doesn't apply to you."
 0  
24      Karl sighed resignedly.
 0  
48      "It doesn't apply to me... and I don't know why
53  that is. I'm trying to get to the bottom of it. But I
51  can't take it any longer... I think I might have to
44  shoot myself in the head. We had parents, we
47  had a happy childhood, we lived with them until
48  we were twenty or thereabouts... I mean, I lived
--------------------
48  with them till then, because you only moved away
45  from Mother thirteen years later, you loser,"
29  Karl laughed unintentionally.
 0  
43      "Yes, that's me down to the ground," Anton
46  said, his face twisting in a cynical smile. He
44  could see that his brother was in a wretched
46  psychological state and he didn't want to risk
47  leaving him alone in his bizarre questing. "I'm
46  not saying I believe you. But I'm not saying I
49  won't help you, either. One way or another, we'll
41  get through this together. Like we've got
44  through everything else. What do you suggest
25  we should do next, then?"
 0  
46      Karl heaved an evident sigh of relief. "Right
46  now, I'm giving some thought to conspiracy and
--------------------
47  parascientific theories." He'd clearly acquired
45  new energy for the task. "Since rationalism's
46  failed me for the time being, we might as well
48  look for answers somewhere else. It can't hurt."
 0  
47      "You could be right. Scientists are a bit like
45  public officials. Bureaucrats have an irksome
48  characteristic; they continually try to describe
47  everything. Take any example you like. Works of
44  art. I can just see a pen-pusher compiling a
47  catalogue... or drawing up a parliamentary bill
39  concerning the nation's heritage... and
41  describing Velazquez's _S_u_r_r_e_n_d_e_r _o_f _B_r_e_d_a
45  down to the very last detail. It's kind of...
15  dehumanising." 
 0  
34      Anton thought for a moment before
--------------------
12  continuing. 
 0  
39      "Or, even better... Pierre Schaeffer's
43  _m_u_s_i_q_u_e _c_o_n_c_r__t_e," he chuckled. "Of course.
46  There's a multitude of works where any attempt
46  whatsoever to describe them verbally... even a
49  successful one... immediately distorts the work's
48  meaning, significance and purpose absolutely. In
38  a case like that, a verbal description
38  simultaneously becomes a deformation."
 0  
42      Karl mused over his brother's words for a
42  moment. Then he took up the conversational
 7  thread.
 0  
45      "OK. [A] We could talk to a group postulating
46  the existence of the Mandela effect. You could
--------------------
41  say they believe that alternate realities
45  overlap and that people unknowingly percolate
46  between them. Something else that'd be apt are
46  the kind of [B] sects that believe the world is
47  simply a computer game. I've seen their members
44  hanging around in the streets several times,
47  wearing cybergothic outfits and clutching weird
47  banners. And maybe we should also look into the
45  conspiracy theories which say that the Moon's
16  made of cheese."
 0  
41      Anton laughed, though a touch nervously.
 0  
46      "I know a woman who's involved in creationist
41  theory," he said. Perhaps we should check
43  whether, perchance, [C] the Lord God Himself
20  isn't punishing us?"
--------------------

Lines: 102, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-A----------------
44      They made their way slowly through the town
40  and Karl was dismayed as he assessed the
41  extent of the decline in the structure of
49  reality. There was almost no traffic. Pedestrians
49  were a rarity. The buildings which still remained
47  were intermittent. The district looked like the
43  jaw of a man who'd been smacked hard in the
45  face with an iron and lost every other tooth.
 0  
47      In order to distract himself and stop thinking
48  about this, if only for a moment, Karl tackled a
16  different topic.
 0  
48      "I sometimes wonder why you're still single. If
45  it isn't a sensitive subject, that is? I know
46  you've always got someone on the go, but never
10  for good."
--------------------
 0  
45      Anton gave a lopsided smile and kicked a can
20  lying on the street.
 0  
47      "I don't know." He hesitated. "N-o-o-o, that's
48  a barefaced lie. I know exactly why, but I don't
52  like splitting. Listen, love's like the coccyx. It's
45  an atavism. An archaic, evolutionary vestige,
45  not needed or noticed by anyone any more, and
47  so... disappearing. It traces back to the times
45  when a woman needed protecting, defending and
46  security and that's also why the tie between a
35  woman and her partner-protector was
42  indispensable. A tie that, in effect, also
41  provided security to their issue and thus
42  guaranteed the uninterrupted passing on of
13  their genes."
--------------------
 0  
45      He spat on the asphalt. They walked on for a
45  moment in silence. Finally, Anton took up the
13  thread again.
 0  
42      "Doesn't it seem to you that love's grown
48  shallower, that it's contracted, become stunted?
43  Vanished, like a superfluous organ, because
46  women don't need protection any more... or, at
40  any rate, that's how it appears to them.
47  Romantic feelings don't really occur, while the
40  commonplace human impulses of caring and
46  nurturing that still remain here and there are
39  simply met with animosity, prejudice or
12  repugnance."
 0  
44      Karl didn't respond. He was musing over how
--------------------
46  diversely the same world could be perceived by
17  different people.
 0  
44      They'd searched on the Internet and found a
46  local group of devotees to the Mandela effect.
46  The group's activities were typical; meetings,
43  lectures, film screenings and, of course, a
47  lively presence on YouTube, as well. They had a
43  rented room at their disposal and that very
45  day they were giving an introductory talk for
25  those new to the subject.
 0  
44      Karl and Anton came into the room and found
43  a couple of seats. There was an audience of
40  some dozen or so people in total and the
46  presentation had already started. The speaker,
48  a tall, skinny man with a shrill, squeaky voice,
--------------------
18  was holding forth.
 0  
42      "...and so, as you can see, the theory of
44  which I am an adherent is primarily based on
48  people... on the relationships between specific,
43  living people who remember alternate facts,
40  people who are witnesses to an alternate
48  version of history, to a range of events... they
46  are the walking proof of the fact that certain
41  things occurred differently from what the
48  official records say; they bore different names,
46  they looked different and so forth. Someone or
42  something introduces concrete changes into
45  reality, sometimes major, sometime minor, but
45  even though those changes evade the attention
45  of most, there's always a group of people who
46  _d_o notice. It might be that a parallel line of
--------------------
48  reality collides with ours. But it could be that
40  someone deliberately interferes with our
48  space-time, for example, as part of a scientific
43  experiment. We suspect that the experiments
41  carried out at the CERN laboratory are to
44  blame. But one way or another, the upshot is
46  that our reality gets mixed up with a parallel
45  world, which causes some people to remember a
46  version of the past that's different from what
47  everyone else recalls. Since you're here today,
47  in all likelihood most of you have noticed that
48  some films have different scenes, or a different
41  ending, that some products have different
46  names, that the facts presented in the history
48  books are out of kilter... to say nothing of the
 7  Bible."

--------------------
44      Once the talk was over and the audience was
42  dispersing, the brothers managed to have a
29  word with the skinny speaker.
 0  
40      "You are aware of how insane your story
45  sounds, aren't you?" their beanpole of a host
 9  squeaked.
 0  
48      'Just look who's talking,' Karl thought, but he
19  kept it to himself.
 0  
39      "I'm sorry, but I can't help you," the
41  beanpole continued. "I don't believe your
46  theory. I don't see any of the manifestations.
45  Everything's vanishing? Come on! Everything's
38  just the same as always. N-o-o-o. What
41  interests us are changes... geographical,
--------------------
48  factual, anatomical. Changes in nomenclature, in
49  design, in film dialogues. Even if one recognises
47  that a vanishing object also constitutes a kind
51  of change... well, if it was a manifestation of the
47  Mandela Effect, an entire group of people would
47  unquestionably have noticed. That's the crux of
12  the matter."
 0  
44      "Oh well, there we are. One way or another,
49  it was worth giving it a try," said Anton as they
50  were leaving the building. "After listening to all
43  that twaddle, I really can see that they're
48  actually involved in something that's completely
44  different from what brought us here. They're
47  two utterly different things. We'll think about
26  what to do next tomorrow."
 0  
--------------------
45      It was, indeed, now late, so they went their
43  separate ways after [A] agreeing to meet the
14  following day.

Lines: 139, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-B----------------
38      The sect generally handed out copious
48  quantities of leaflets in town, which is why the
44  area where its headquarters were located was
40  common knowledge. As they made their way
45  there, Karl felt disheartened and frightened,
46  because he knew just how many injuries reality
46  had sustained. While it seemed to him that the
43  streets were sunnier than usual, he quickly
47  realised that the town was quite simply missing
48  significant swathes of its buildings. Instead of
39  the rush-hour crush, the pavements were
45  almost deserted. The traffic on the roads had
34  more or less died away completely.
 0  
38      Anton was utterly unaware of this and
48  strode along at a lively pace, talking about his
17  erotic conquests.
--------------------
 0  
49      "... so, that's what last week was like. And the
47  day before yesterday I met this blonde. It took
49  me quite some time to talk that one into sex, but
49  I won in the end. I had her, right on her kitchen
 7  table."
 0  
40      "Oh. Did she have anything against it?"
 0  
46      "Yup. The washing machine. But don't worry, I
33  moved that out of the way first."
 0  
43      Along the way, Karl threw a few coins to a
45  beggar standing by a shop. 'He'd better spend
49  them quickly,' he thought anxiously. 'He mightn't
27  have much time for it now.'
 0  
--------------------
42      "What're you giving money to tramps for?"
48  Anton asked in surprise. "He'll only drink it. I
47  don't know. It's like you kissed a prostitute's
31  hand or something of the kind."
 0  
42      "May you never have first-hand experience
46  of the fact that beggars are human beings just
49  like you, only things didn't work out so well for
43  them," Karl growled in annoyance. "You know
47  how it goes... times of prosperity are when the
44  criminals are living better than royalty and
46  times of crisis are when the criminals are the
49  only people living the good life. And by the way,
43  if you must know, it so happens that I _h_a_v_e
29  kissed a prostitute's hand." 
 0  
34      "How come?" Anton gazed at him in
--------------------
13  astonishment.
 0  
46      "In the usual course of things. I left and it
40  seemed courteous to say goodbye. A woman
45  deserves respect. And anyway, a touch of good
43  manners never killed anyone yet, you boor!"
 0  
43      They had now arrived at their destination.
47  There wasn't so much as an inch of the building
46  that wasn't covered in graffiti. Slogans leapt
46  out at them from the walls; 'You are someone's
47  tamagotchi', 'Leaving the game is a deadly sin'
50  and the like. With thoughts of sects in mind, Karl
44  had been expecting figures gliding around in
45  silence, clad in habits or gauzy robes at the
48  very least. The sight that greeted them, though,
44  was a gaudy, vociferous rabble encamped both
--------------------
47  outside the entrance and inside. People of both
45  sexes rocking the cybergoth look were gaming,
36  most often on handheld devices or on
41  computers or home consoles in the various
46  rooms. Some were enthusiastically taking drugs
44  in various forms and some were having sex in
 7  public.
 0  
32      The group's leader welcomed the
42  newly-arrived brothers and ordered them to
17  call him 'abbot'.
 0  
39      "...though this colourful gang call me
47  'Commander of the Teutonic Order' for a laugh,"
22  he added in amusement.
 0  
39      He looked completely normal; he wasn't
--------------------
43  wearing make-up, coloured contact lenses or
44  any kind of mask and his head wasn't crowned
42  by a mohican. He didn't even have any body
49  piercings or tattoos.... or not anywhere that was
21  visible, at any rate.
 0  
45      "Sure," he continued. "The whole universe is
42  just a computer game we're taking part in.
46  Actually, the word 'just' just doesn't cut it.
47  Really, I should use the phrase 'no less than'.
40  After all, you can do what you want in a
43  computer game. Absolute freedom rules here,
41  because we know that everything around us
19  isn't real anyway."
 0  
28      Anton thought for a moment.
 0  
--------------------
44      "Absolute freedom?" he asked. "Including...
 8  murder?"
 0  
44      "Of course," said the abbot. "We believe we
47  get extra points for frags. Besides, if you get
47  rid of another player from the game, they still
49  have loads of lives and, ultimately, you can also
47  start the game again from scratch. What's more,
46  there's a high likelihood that you'll actually
46  have got rid of an NPC. We do what we fancy...
42  what it's about is the game giving as much
46  pleasure as possible. After all, that's why we
16  play, isn't it?"
 0  
37      "Hang on," said Karl, who was rather
26  confused. "What's an NPC?"
 0  
--------------------
40      The abbot gave him a reproving look. "A
43  non-player character, of course. Characters
43  generated by the computer and programmed to
43  interact with the players so as to make the
23  game more interesting."
 0  
48      "In other words... it's a kind of... futuristic
24  solipsism?" asked Anton.
 0  
45      "I'd say it's the direct opposite. We're not
43  solipsists and we're not into materialistic
49  agnosticism, either. Solipsism says that only the
49  observing subject is real and that reality in its
45  entirety is simply the set of his or her own,
48  subjective impressions, while all the people and
45  inanimate objects encountered are, so to say,
48  parts of the mind of the individual experiencing
--------------------
39  them. Whereas we allow for a completely
46  different possibility... who can vouch for the
48  fact that you or I really exist, that, actually,
45  we're players? Maybe we don't really exist at
48  all? We might be stuck here in the form of NPCs,
47  constituting nothing more than a background for
45  some real person-player. From what I can see,
45  you're both NPCs, too, your characters are so
23  lousily put-together." 
 0  
41      In the end, the abbot stated that Karl's
44  problem was of absolutely no interest to him
43  and that he wasn't going to devote any more
45  time to non-existent people because he had to
45  collect more game points. Concerned that this
46  might mean they were about to become a way for
39  him to acquire more frags, the brothers
--------------------
29  hurriedly left the building. 
 0  
41      It was now so late that they arranged to
42  continue their quest the next day. [A] Karl
24  resignedly set off home.

Lines: 158, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-C----------------
38      They made their way slowly toward the
44  restaurant where Anton had arranged for them
46  to meet his acquaintance, Anna Koenig, who was
45  a doctor of theology and, at one and the same
29  time, a militant creationist.
 0  
43      "I'm really not convinced that this is the
42  right track," Karl muttered as they walked
40  along. "You know what they say about all
48  religious fanatics... to them, truth, understood
48  as a description of an actual state, constitutes
20  a personal affront."
 0  
37      "It was you who said 'since rational
29  solutions have failed us'..."
 0  
37      "Yes, yes, I know. Very well, then."
--------------------
 0  
45      They walked on in silence for a minute. Karl
46  was trying to assess just how many elements of
31  reality had now been subject to
47  dematerialisation. The town was noticeably less
42  densely built-up than it had been only the
41  previous day. The traffic was practically
14  indiscernible.
 0  
39      Finally, Karl turned to a new topic of
47  conversation, chiefly in order to take his mind
43  off his growing sense of fear for a moment.
 0  
40      "Do you know her personally? Can you go
42  into any detail? How does she behave? What
46  does she look like? She's bound to take us for
10  lunatics."
--------------------
 0  
40      "Ah, well, a tall, gorgeous redhead..."
 0  
43      Karl gave his brother a suspicious glance.
 0  
43      "Not so long ago, your basic criterion for
46  judging female beauty was 'What a looker! Like
35  something out of a porn flick!'..."
 0  
46      "Of course. It still is. There's no reason to
47  go changing an efficient system of evaluation."
 0  
44      "And you're surprised you're still single."
 0  
16      Anton shrugged.
 0  
46      "I'm not surprised at all. I'm not a child. I
--------------------
45  know very well that life can never compare to
13  good cinema."
 0  
44      It turned out that Anna was already waiting
41  for them and it became clear that Anton's
43  description of her had been spot on, at any
46  rate. It could even be said to have hovered on
30  the borders of understatement.
 0  
41      Contrary to Karl's fears, she heard them
26  out with genuine interest.
 0  
46      "I don't think that what's happened to you is
44  at all impossible or even unbelievable," she
48  said once they'd finished. "But then... what I'm
42  involved in is what's known as Young Earth
48  Creationism. We build our theory on the basis of
--------------------
47  a biblical interpretation whereby it is evident
47  that our planet is less than six thousand years
49  old... or nine, at the most. Earth, humankind and
43  all life on Earth was created by God in six
46  days. It was then that He made the basic forms
49  of living organisms... the 'baramins' or 'created
42  kinds'. They don't originate from a common
43  ancestor at all, as ridiculous evolutionary
41  theory has it. More specifically... those
43  baramins, those independently created _f_a_u_n_a
47  and _f_l_o_r_a, can change slightly under the impact
44  of stimuli flowing from the environment, for
46  instance, or as a result of various mutations,
48  but only within a highly limited scope. And so I
44  can assure you that monkeys and humans don't
49  have a common ancestor... not at all." She smiled
48  with such charm that, if Karl had been standing,
--------------------
45  his knees would have almost given way beneath
 4  him.
 0  
42      "In that case, how do you explain species
48  dying out?" Anton asked. "Let's take the classic
26  example of the dinosaurs."
 0  
45      "It's easy to explain by global catastrophes
45  like the biblical Flood... and similar," Anna
45  replied like a shot, brushing a curly lock of
44  auburn hair away from her face with a subtle
47  gesture which had Karl thanking his lucky stars
39  that he was firmly seated on his chair.
 0  
37      "However," she continued, "first and
43  foremost, we maintain that the universe was
42  created by God from nothing, in accordance
--------------------
48  with the principle of _c_r_e_a_t_i_o _e_x _n_i_h_i_l_o. So it's
48  not inconceivable that, at the end of the world,
40  the universe could return to that _n_i_h_i_l.
44  Moreover, since it was created gradually, it
43  might also cease to exist in the same way."
 0  
44      Karl and Anton immediately pricked up their
 5  ears.
 0  
41      "In that case, why's the phenomenon only
38  being perceived by one person?!" Anton
 9  enquired.
 0  
44      "God is merciful. He could be shielding the
46  fact that the Apocalypse is beginning from our
44  eyes," Anna responded. Then, in an unusually
44  calm and gentle tone, she added, "Since it's
--------------------
37  only your brother who can see the end
45  approaching, he's undoubtedly God's Prophet."
 0  
43      Karl experienced a sudden rush of heat. He
43  felt that he had to get away from the table
46  without further ado. He wanted to be alone for
37  a minute, to gather himself together.
 0  
43      "Excuse me for a moment," he said. "I must
28  just go and powder my nose."
 0  
45      He walked into the toilet, turned on the tap
46  and immersed his hands and face in cold water.
44  The world was spinning in front of his eyes.
44  'Prophet? What fucking prophet?!' he thought
41  feverishly. 'What apocalypse?! It's sheer
 9  madness!'
--------------------
 0  
42      When he returned to the table some ten or
48  so minutes later, Anton was sitting there alone.
 0  
44      "Where's Anna? Has she left? That quickly?"
11  Karl asked.
 0  
42      "Anna? What Anna?" Anton looked genuinely
47  alarmed. "Are you feeling all right? You walked
44  off so suddenly. I mean, we arranged to meet
45  here to decide how to proceed. We're going to
44  go into the Mandela effect and the cyberpunk
35  sect in depth. Don't you remember?"
 0  
43      Without so much as a word, Karl dashed out
46  of the restaurant and [A] fled for home as fast
28  as his legs would carry him.
--------------------

Lines: 153, max 178

-----------------CHAPTER-D----------------
42      At home, Karl continued to reflect on the
34  events of the day. A return to the
40  consideration of scientific paths seemed
46  essential. He knew a couple more physicists...
44  and, in order not to be deemed a lunatic, he
45  could present the whole affair as a story. He
42  could tell a barefaced lie and say that he
38  needed another series of consultations
34  regarding one of his sci-fi books.
 0  
45      In the end, he concluded that he didn't have
47  the time for half measures and that he'd go for
49  broke. However, rather than a brilliant theorist,
44  he chose an excellent practitioner... Doctor
45  Vloshin. And he lied through his teeth on the
 6  phone.
 0  
--------------------
43      "Doctor Vloshin? It's Karl. Yes. Could you
51  listen... Well, no, it's not exactly a consultation
49  this time. Actually, think what you like, as long
47  as you solve the problem, because what I've got
48  for you today is an unusual matter, but a highly
44  lucrative one. Please imagine a hypothetical
46  situation where reality's fading away for some
49  reason. I don't know. No, I haven't got a clue...
47  you're the physicist, so I'm asking you to come
43  up with something. Yes. It's about urgently
43  developing a way of connecting every single
45  object of reality stably so as to prevent its
48  irrevocable disintegration. And I'm leaving that
50  to you. A model, a formula, a machine... anything.
47  I know you're busy, but I've saved the best for
47  last... you can set your own price for the job.
49  What? Yes. Absolutely... ask as much as you like.
--------------------
48  Of course I can afford it. Just accept that I've
45  received a legacy from an aunt. That's right.
51  Fucking rich. OK. So I'll be waiting for your call.
39  Roll up your sleeves and get on to it!"
 0  
44      'I should've flashed a roll of banknotes at
48  once,' Karl thought, as he ended the call. "Even
45  those imaginary ones. I'll worry about paying
47  later. But what Vloshin doesn't know can't hurt
52  him. And if he fails..., [A] then I won't be worrying
31  about anything at all any more.

-----------------CHAPTER-E----------------
42      Evening came. Judith still hadn't gone to
42  sleep. She was looking at something on the
45  computer, lying on the bed, barefoot, wearing
50  fairly tight-fitting jeans and a loose shirt. Karl
43  sometimes wondered whether she dressed like
45  that because she knew just how much the style
47  appealed to him or if she simply did it because
47  she was comfortable like that. Or, perhaps, for
13  both reasons.
 0  
45      He was sitting in his desk chair, flanked by
46  a small, sculpted lamp on one side and a glass
45  and a half-empty bottle on the other. Bourbon
46  was the only form of corn he would tolerate on
45  the menu. He was trying to write something...
50  anything at all... but, first and foremost, he was
47  silently contemplating Judith. This wasn't only
--------------------
49  because, lying there in the pool of light cast by
46  the night lamp amidst the dimness of the room,
47  she was material for a painting or, at the very
48  least, an excellent photo. It was also by way of
46  the fact that she was the last anchor securing
46  him in a state of relative mental equilibrium.
 0  
47      "Hell, it's not coming, " he muttered, glaring
22  at the sheet of paper.
 0  
44      "What?" Judith asked, tearing her attention
44  away from the computer. "I'm sorry. I didn't
22  catch what you said." 
 0  
42      "I'm saying that it's stupid somehow. I'm
52  striving to digest a... recent event. I've called it
21  _T_r_e_e_s _o_n _t_h_e _C_l_o_u_d_s."
--------------------
 0  
43      "OK, go on, read it, read it," she smiled,
48  knowing that, as usual, this was his awkward way
20  of seeking her help.
 0  
45      Karl cleared his throat and started to read,
39  trying to convey the tone of his female
 9  narrator.

43      "What do you think?" he asked, raising his
19  eyes from the text.
 0  
38      Judith wasn't there. He stared at the
45  immaculately made, utterly empty bed. Then he
44  leapt to his feet and searched every room in
49  terror, leaving a veritable shambles in his wake.
47  There wasn't a living soul to be seen. Judith's
49  clothes... her toiletries... photos of the two of
48  them... all missing. Not a trace of her remained
46  except the memories held in his frenzied mind.
--------------------
 0  
41      He had absolutely no idea what to do. He
44  searched feverishly for his mobile phone and
44  selected Anton's number from his speed dial.
44  '_T_h_e _n_u_m_b_e_r _y_o_u _h_a_v_e _d_i_a_l_l_e_d _d_o_e_s _n_o_t _e_x_i_s_t.

46  disconnected. He didn't have a shadow of doubt
46  about what that meant. There was no Anton now.
29  He fell inertly onto the bed.

36      Almost two weeks had passed. He was
47  drinking almost non-stop. He never went out. In
45  fact, he barely even got out of bed. Mess and
35  semi-darkness reigned in the house.
 0  
--------------------
41      Loneliness undoubtedly makes itself felt
50  differently in everyone. Karl identified it thanks
48  to the television. In his opinion, you recognise
46  loneliness by the fact that, when you go for a
41  shower, you're frightened to turn off the
40  television as you leave the room because
47  you're scared of the space you'll find when you
40  come back later. Still and dark. Silent.
 0  
38      Karl never turned the television off.
 0  
35      First the number of programmes and
42  presenters had diminished. And for several
46  days now, there'd been nothing showing but the
15  same two films.

40      He opened another bottle, his movements
46  unsteady, but he passed out after a few swigs.
32  Several hours later, he woke up.

47      He struggled to his feet and, with difficulty,
39  staggered to the toilet. The sound of a
47  telephone ringing drifted from the room, but he
47  was still extremely drunk, so he didn't make it
48  back in time to answer the call. When he finally
35  focused on the phone screen, he was
42  astonished to discover that the caller was
42  Doctor Vloshin. He'd left a voice message.
--------------------
 0  
41      "Come round to my lab. I think I'm on to
46  something...." But that was all there was. The
41  words were followed by an explosion and a
 7  scream.
 0  
37      Karl collapsed into an armchair with
44  resignation and mused at length over whether
46  he should [A] head over to Vloshin's laboratory
47  or finish the bottle and not take any action...
51  whatever it might be... until the next day. Or in a
43  week's time. [B] Or whenever he acknowledged
43  that it was of any consequence whatsoever.

43      Just in case, he took his pistol with him,
45  which was most probably an irrational measure
42  and gave him nothing more than an illusory
16  sense of safety.
 0  
42      The land which had once been the town was
47  now scarcely a built environment at all. It was
46  almost completely deserted... Karl saw no more
46  than three, perhaps four people along the way.
49  Even though it was late morning, it wasn't at all
46  light. A great, dark hole gaped in the Sun and
45  expanded with each day that passed. Maybe the
47  Sun was too large to vanish all at once...? The
44  Moon had ceased to exist several days before
47  and Karl had been thinking about how this would
39  generally be affecting the tides or the
44  equilibrium of the Solar System. In the end,
--------------------
46  though, he'd come to the conclusion that since
44  elements of reality were dematerialising, it
45  wasn't inconceivable that the laws of physics
38  were also vanishing one after another.
 0  
45      He reached his destination and went into the
46  building, now solitary, but once a part of the
43  metropolitan sprawl. He made his way slowly
41  along an unlit stairwell. The silence was
46  overwhelming. He pressed down on the handle of
44  the door to the laboratory. It was unlocked.
 0  
43      The room was in disarray, saturated with a
42  whole mass of smells on a spectrum ranging
47  from unpleasant to repulsive. Amongst them, the
45  odour that reigned supreme was something like
40  a combination of ozone and the stench of
--------------------
15  burned plastic.
 0  
44      The voice was very faint, which is why Karl
48  didn't hear it at all to start with. However, he
45  knew there was another room here and from the
43  other side of the door, which was currently
47  hidden behind a stack of electronic scrap, came
44  a quiet gibbering... incomprehensible words,
31  repeated in an unbroken stream.
 0  
44      He shifted the pile of scrap and cautiously
48  stepped into the room. He couldn't see very well
43  in the darkness that surrounded him, but he
47  had a sense that something was wrong... some of
46  the furniture and objects were arranged at odd
43  angles and gave the impression of literally
46  permeating other pieces of furniture and other
--------------------
47  items. A man was lying on the floor, covered by
45  a filthy blanket. He was facing away from the
44  door and he was almost completely motionless
46  apart from the febrile movement of his lips as
44  his faltering voice repeated the same words,
39  over and over again. Like a incongruous
15  counting rhyme.
 0  
28      Karl slowly approached him.
 0  
47      ...glue is here, glue is there, glue is gluing
48  everywhere, glue is here, glue is there, glue is
47  gluing everywhere, glue is here, glue is there,
43  glue is gluing everywhere..." the recumbent
30  figure gibbered without pause.
 0  
39      It was only after Karl had removed the
--------------------
40  blanket that it became clear that Doctor
41  Vloshin's experiment couldn't be numbered
48  amongst the successful... and that he offered no
45  promise whatsoever of salvation. He wasn't so
39  much lying on the floor as inextricably
48  integrated with it along the entire back half of
46  his body. With his face turned upwards and his
39  gaze utterly crazed, he was ceaselessly
44  reciting his terrifying string of words in a
30  voice growing steadily weaker.
 0  
43      Karl shot him and [A] quickly left the lab.

Lines: 80, max 186

-----------------CHAPTER-G----------------
44      Karl couldn't goad himself into any kind of
39  action whatsoever. He was scarcely even
47  capable of dragging himself from the bed... and
41  he was aware of the fact that this wasn't
46  because he was excessively drunk. Mind you, it
46  honestly had to be admitted that his condition
41  was a long way from sober. He just wanted
22  everything to be over.
 0  
43      The nights were the worst, because most of
46  the stars had vanished now, while the Moon had
47  ceased to exist the previous week. It seemed as
49  if the universe was caving in on itself, with the
46  centre of the collapse being the Solar System,
45  or even Earth itself. Could what they said be
50  true... that the universe doesn't exist without an
38  observer? Alcohol was hampering Karl's
--------------------
47  thinking. For a long moment, he couldn't recall
44  the name of the scientist he and Vloshin had
42  once talked about. Ah, yes, that was it...
47  Schrodinger. Erwin Schrodinger, his fucking cat
43  and his interpretation of the principles of
38  quantum mechanics. Some tosh about the
44  behaviour of elementary particles that exist
41  simultaneously in every possible physical
52  location. But, specifically... only until the moment
46  when the fact of measurement or, quite simply,
45  of observation, occurs. Only when a cognisant
46  observer's attention turned to those particles
47  would this cause a given particle to assume one
47  defined state. In Vloshin's opinion, this meant
48  that reality couldn't exist without an observer,
44  while a person cognisant of nothing would...
47  Godlike or, at the very least, demiurge-like...
--------------------
45  summon reality into being by their cognisance
44  and the very act of observing. Or... keep it
38  tightly reigned in and protect it from
18  disintegration...?
 0  
44      The light switch on the wall was definitely
45  quite a distance away from Karl, but such was
48  the darkness now that it would be difficult even
46  to aim the bottle accurately at his mouth, let
47  alone grope around for it on the bedside table.
45  In the situation that had arisen, any loss of
42  booze at all, no matter what the quantity,
47  assumed disaster proportions, which is why Karl
48  did, in fact, make an effort and finally managed
44  to turn on the light. He didn't know how his
42  glance happened not to fall on the bedside
45  table holding the bourbon, but on the writing
--------------------
40  desk where he kept his weapon. He slowly
45  opened the drawer. The pistol hadn't vanished
30  yet; it was still lying there.
 0  
44      Karl took a healthy pull from the bottle...
46  healthy enough to set his head spinning, so he
48  collapsed onto the bed. Lying there, he recalled
45  a daft conversation he'd had with his brother
16  not long before.
 0  
40      "Do you sometimes wonder whether you've
40  already bought your Deathbed?" Anton had
 6  asked.
 0  
19      "How do you mean?"
 0  
46      "Well, you know," said Anton, with a chuckle,
--------------------
44  "when you buy a new bed at our age, it's not
47  inconceivable that it'll last you to the end of
11  your life."
 0  
41      Karl gazed at the pistol in his hand and
34  then [A] made his bed his Deathbed.

Lines: 74, max 186

-----------------CHAPTER-H----------------
45      Karl stood, helpless, in the deserted street
40  and wondered what to do next. Everything
45  seemed to be pointing to the fact that no one
47  was capable of halting the annihilation. And in
46  that case... what would happen now, what would
45  actually remain once everything had vanished?
46  The question fascinated Karl in a ghastly sort
11  of fashion.
 0  
37      People are usually fascinated by the
47  concept of infinity. They find it mind-boggling
48  that anything at all could be infinite. However,
42  infinity had recently seemed to Karl to be
49  something safe, if not to say downright familiar.
48  This thinking sprang from the fact that, to him,
46  infinity stood in opposition to the concept of
36  the oncoming nothingness he had been
--------------------
46  observing. Not nothingness in the sense of the
47  cosmic void, though, because even in that, some
44  particle or other might be encountered. For,
48  after all... how could _a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e_l_y _n_o_t_h_i_n_g exist?
 0  
43      On the whole, scientists were engaged with
45  what fills space. Maybe they should also have
46  interested themselves in what is found in that
46  'place' where our space is absent. The thought
39  that the universe is infinite had never
48  triggered fear, or even anxiety, in Karl. On the
48  contrary... recently, that thought had seemed to
43  calm, comfort and cheer him. He was able to
45  comprehend a universe thus conceived of. Even
43  if it were an infinite universe composed of
46  smaller universes like ours. However, his hair
46  stood on end at the very thought that, at some
--------------------
45  moment, the continuum of things would come to
44  an end and that there was absolutely nothing
47  beyond it. So what would that _a_b_s_o_l_u_t_e void be?
47  How was it going to be located beyond the world
45  of things if that world actually proved to be
42  finite? That void which was most evidently
18  hastening here...?
 0  
42      They are wont to say that, ever since the
42  Big Bang, our universe has been expanding.
41  However, Karl was wondering... into what,
41  specifically, was it expanding? Into what
40  environment? Or had the universe started
42  contracting again, perhaps... and was that
42  precisely what had been taking place every
23  day, slowly but surely?
 0  
--------------------
42      To begin with, Karl had still hoped that,
51  paradoxically, infinity... despite the fact that it
49  was, by nature, boundless... might, however, be a
39  _s_u_i _g_e_n_e_r_i_s containment of nothingness.
43  Unfortunately, it was becoming evident that
40  nothingness was consistently prevailing.
 0  
44      "Oh, well," he muttered to himself, "as the
44  philosopher said, 'I think, therefore I am a
 7  joke'."
 0  
42      He decided to try and evaluate the losses
47  that had arisen thus far, to find out something
45  beyond conversations with scientists... never
47  mind whether they were devoted to the spirit or
47  to the material... something beyond the results
48  of observing the town or watching television. So
--------------------
42  he gave some thought as to whether he'd [A]
42  head for the nearest church or, perhaps [B]
47  make his way to the Municipal Offices, the seat
20  of the Town Council.

Lines: 72, max 186

-----------------CHAPTER-I----------------
41      Only a few weeks earlier, the church had
46  been part of an entire group of buildings. Now
41  it stood there, a solitary edifice in the
46  wilderness... and, a dozen or so metres beyond
50  it, the world ended. Literally. Karl absorbed that
47  discovery with astonishing composure. He walked
47  gingerly over to the end of the world. Just as,
48  behind him, the day held sway, with the scrap of
47  the Sun that still remained shining in the sky,
46  so now, suddenly and without warning, in front
44  of his eyes, spread the sable black of outer
44  space, with no more than a meagre handful of
42  stars scattered here and there. The ground
47  broke off along one and the same line, but Karl
46  didn't dare lean out over the edge, because he
46  suspected that there'd be no atmosphere on the
40  other side, to say nothing of the deadly
--------------------
50  temperature. It didn't matter all that much to him
42  whether it was 180 degrees Celsius or even
45  absolute zero; he had no desire to experience
43  it at first hand for as long as that proved
47  possible... especially when his supposition was
46  lent credence by the stone he threw at the end
47  of the world for experimental purposes. Once it
41  had crossed that incredible border, it no
46  longer flew in an arc, but in a straight line,
49  without slowing down, majestically moving further
45  and further away until it finally disappeared
45  into what had once been called interplanetary
 6  space.
 0  
41      The side chapel in the church was empty,
16  dark and silent.
 0  
--------------------
44      "Hello?!" Karl called. His own voice seemed
42  spectral to him in the silence and a long,
41  drawn-out echo drifted through the space,
47  sending a chill up his spine. "Is there anybody
 6  here?"
 0  
40      A distant sound drifted towards him and
44  then, from behind a row of columns, a priest
25  emerged in the side nave.
 0  
45      "Welcome, my son. I'm the parish priest. How
42  can I help you?" His voice as he spoke was
 7  mellow.
 0  
45      Karl wasn't an overly pious man. He'd read a
47  large enough portion of the Bible to know that,
44  if he read the whole thing, he'd undoubtedly
--------------------
47  lose his last vestiges of faith. He studied the
44  parish priest, who was a man past his prime,
40  but in good shape for all that, with his
44  luxuriant head of silver hair and liturgical
39  robes giving him a look that was almost
10  dignified.
 0  
45      "Are you seeking God, my son? A service will
46  be starting quite soon. Would you care to join
 4  us?"
 0  
43      "You know, Father... I think that, if some
47  Higher Entities were to create some intelligent
44  beings as an experiment, but programmed them
43  in such a way as to reach their aims by the
49  most difficult paths possible, without perceiving
44  any of the obvious solutions, then the final
--------------------
46  outcome would be human beings. Us. In general,
44  people prefer not to see the truth. Instead,
46  they immediately create a prosthesis of it and
49  only then act on the basis of that. In my case, I
48  think it's like this, that maybe I do believe in
31  God... but do I believe God...?
 0  
37      "So what is it you want?" The parish
29  priest's tone was now chilly.
 0  
50      "I... I'm writing an article on the subject of...
52  er... the Roman Catholic Church... is it always this
42  deserted? Would it be possible to know how
39  many faithful there are in the parish?"
 0  
42      "Ever since I have been serving here, and
38  that will soon be seventeen years, our
--------------------
33  community has been composed of Mr
43  Morgenstern." The priest's chasuble rustled
24  with every move he made.
 0  
41      "Has been composed of..." Karl strove to
43  comprehend the odd syntax. "Father, are you
44  telling me that, for seventeen years, you've
45  been celebrating Mass for one person? Doesn't
28  that strike you as strange?"
 0  
43      "I don't understand what your concern is,"
46  the priest responded matter-of-factly. "It is,
45  after all, a perfect and natural image of the
44  dualism of God and humankind. That truth was
46  also proclaimed to us by the Lord Jesus Christ
49  and His Apostle. Since you're writing an article,
41  sir, you should be more familiar with the
--------------------
11  Testament."
 0  
44      "I'd be interested to know which one," Karl
37  muttered. The priest stared at him in
13  astonishment.
 0  
45      "What do you mean, 'which one'? Is this some
44  kind of blasphemous joke?! There is only _o_n_e
11  Testament!"
 0  
46      Karl left the chapel without uttering a word.
 0  
41      He stood outside the church for a moment
48  and wondered what else he might, in fact, do. To
47  be sure, [A] Professor Benedikt, the last of the
46  scientists Karl had consulted about his books,
41  was an eccentric old man... providing the
--------------------
51  venerable scholar still existed, that is..., but it
47  looked as if all the other options had now been
10  exhausted.
 0  
44      Before he walked off, Karl gazed once again
45  at the bottomless blackness barely a few feet
44  away. He'd heard that a person standing on a
43  precipice sometimes has an incomprehensible
45  urge to jump. Perhaps he should take the rope
47  that hung from the bell in the church tower and
46  try [B] to investigate what lies beyond the end
45  of the world... ? 'Leap from Earth into outer
43  space... this might be the only chance,' he
45  mused. 'Since the air isn't escaping from the
46  terrestrial atmosphere over that extraordinary
45  border, maybe there's some kind of atmosphere
47  on the other side...?' The idea was insane, but
--------------------
44  couldn't the same be said of everything that
29  had happened in recent weeks?

-----------------CHAPTER-J----------------
46      On the way to the municipal offices, Karl was
45  struck with terror when he noticed that, here
40  and there, the ground had opened up into
48  sprawling holes that gaped onto a black void. He
46  presumed that, at the very least, certain laws
45  of physics weren't functioning in those sable
43  regions, since objects large and small were
45  floating there... sticks and stones, but also
47  paving stones, street lights and other elements
46  of the town's infrastructure. There were birds
35  or insects above some of the holes,
38  desperately flapping their wings in an
51  ineffective attempt to get away and take flight. It
48  looked as if a state of weightlessness held sway
37  both inside the holes and above them.
 0  
43      Karl carefully avoided these anomalies and
--------------------
45  slowly headed towards his destination. He had
45  no taste for contact with the authorities and
47  their representatives. His spirit was more that
45  of an anarchist. In his view, the state as an
48  institution had the nature of an organised crime
45  outfit; it extorted money from people and, in
50  return, offered them services in name only... like
46  the illusion of protection, for instance, this
49  primarily being protection from the state itself,
46  which, just like organised crime, harasses and
40  persecutes those who don't want to pay. 
 0  
47      The municipal office building was still there,
38  although the structure hadn't remained
45  untouched. The main entrance lay to the left,
44  but one of the great, black holes had opened
46  up in the earth to the right and so the entire
--------------------
46  section of the building that had stood on that
43  spot had vanished. The impression this gave
43  was as if a ravenous giant had bitten out a
51  chunk of it... the structure of the interior walls,
45  the floors and various rooms was visible from
45  afar. Even the handful of remaining employees
41  could be seen, wandering around the rooms
38  without the slightest awareness of the
32  singularity of their situation. 
 0  
44      Once Karl went into the building, it turned
41  out that there were even more black holes
41  inside. These were smaller and the clerks
42  making their way hither and thither walked
37  round them with a display of uncommon
49  indifference, to say nothing of agility. Karl was
47  delighted to note the fact that the head of the
--------------------
38  Population Records and Identity Papers
46  Department still existed. He was a middle-aged
42  man, rather unkempt and more disadvantaged
42  than blessed by Nature when his genes were
20  drawn from the pool.
 0  
45      "... that is correct," he said. "We hold the
45  records of every birth and death. At present,
41  our metropolis has fifty-four residents."
 0  
46      "Fifty-... four?" Karl actually choked on the
44  words. "Don't you have the impression that's
41  really rather a small population for a...
12  metropolis?"
 0  
48      "I don't quite follow your meaning. I don't see
42  anything in the data that departs from the
--------------------
 6  norm."
 0  
43      "You public servants never notice anything
46  that'd be inconvenient for you," Karl muttered
47  to himself. However, it seemed he hadn't spoken
45  as quietly as he thought, because the head of
33  department looked at him askance.
 0  
40      "You've no great liking for us, eh?" he
47  asked. "Maybe you've got something to hide from
20  the authorities...?"
 0  
40      "Ah, you see! Suspicion raises its head
48  after an exchange of just a few sentences. No, I
49  don't like you. And I'll tell you one thing. Just
46  imagine this; one person shoots another with a
45  firearm and the person who's been shot simply
--------------------
45  dies. And now imagine that one person grabs a
41  big, thick, heavy stick and beats another
48  person up with it, battering that person's head,
48  their torso, their legs, their genitals, beating
48  them mercilessly, on and on. And, as a result of
44  that unimaginable, interminable torture, the
48  person who's being beaten finally dies. And now,
46  would you kindly explain just how inhuman, how
49  downright diabolical the legislation must be when
43  assault and battery resulting in a death is
46  treated more leniently than a murder committed
44  on the spot?! This is not the law - it's the
41  codified lawlessness!" Karl was genuinely
47  shaking. He had the impression that he couldn't
32  count on help from anywhere now.
 0  
44      "But anarchy inevitably leads to tyranny in
--------------------
50  the end," the philosophical official said. Then he
47  added, "And after what you've just been yelling
48  here, I'm seriously considering whether or not I
42  should report you to the police. You might
45  represent a danger. The fact that you're in a
44  very poor mental state is clear to the naked
 5  eye."
 0  
42      "Go on then, report me!" Karl snarled and
44  marched out of the building. He stood in the
47  midst of the wasteland outside for a moment and
41  wondered what else he could do. Professor
45  Benedikt, the last of the scientists Karl had
47  consulted about his books, was an eccentric old
42  man, to be sure... providing the venerable
51  scholar still existed, that is..., but it looked as
40  if [A] all the other options had now been
--------------------
10  exhausted.

Lines: 120, max 186

-----------------CHAPTER-K----------------
40      It has to be admitted that Karl felt an
40  overwhelming desire to go home and drink
52  himself to death... or, at any rate, to try with all
47  his might to do so. However, it turned out that
44  there was now no possibility of heading that
43  way on account of an enormous black hole in
45  reality. The dark chasm was approximately the
45  size of a sports stadium. There were more and
45  more of them opening up at random. Willing or
40  not, Karl set off to meet the professor.
 0  
39      When he arrived, he saw that an entire
46  group of buildings had so far survived in this
49  part of the town... and that Professor Benedikt's
48  was one of them. The scientist didn't answer the
46  door, so after repeatedly ringing the bell and
46  knocking, Karl pressed down on the handle. The
--------------------
34  door yielded with a dismal creak. 
 0  
43      Inside, darkness reigned. The interior was
39  cold. The power station had undoubtedly
44  vanished by now, while the Sun was evidently
49  slowly coming to the end of its life. The ancient
45  scholar was sitting, motionless, in a rocking
48  chair, a blanket covering him. He was staring at
48  the television screen. The television was turned
46  off. Karl went over to the old man and touched
13  his shoulder.
 0  
16      "Professor...?"
 0  
45      The scientist twitched. It was clear that he
45  hadn't even noticed his visitor until now. He
26  seemed utterly distracted.
--------------------
 0  
48      "I've been wondering..." he said, still staring
47  at the television screen, "...what that item of
47  furniture could be for. I have the feeling that
51  its function is ornamental, but... I can't call the
48  details to mind... Oh, well, old age is probably
12  setting in."
 0  
40      Karl had to devote a good fifteen or so
44  minutes to getting Benedikt to return to his
46  senses. He did everything he possibly could to
48  haul his mind back to reality. As he was talking
47  about the events of recent weeks, he constantly
45  cast nervous glances through the window... he
41  had the impression that the house was now
42  standing on a small island amidst a sea of
19  absolute blackness.
--------------------
 0  
40      "Do you know the theory of the infinite
43  number of worlds?" asked the Professor, who
35  had finally managed to concentrate.
 0  
32      Karl shook his head wordlessly.
 0  
45      "Y-e-e-e-s..." the old man muttered, half to
46  himself. "It was proposed, back in the day, by
50  Hugh Everett III, in the context of the principles
46  of quantum mechanics. Reality is multiplicity.
49  Infinite multiplicity gives an infinite degree of
47  complexity... From what you've said... even one
42  reality was put together in a way that was
49  unimaginable to us, to say nothing of an infinity
48  of them. And what if they're purely potential in
45  nature? Then there'd be only one point of the
--------------------
44  present and it would move obdurately forward
45  in line with the passing of time. Choices are
43  made, decisions are taken and events... are
46  established, described, confirmed, as it were,
29  by the decisions we make..." 
 0  
45      "I don't quite understand what that's got to
41  do with..." Karl began, but the venerable
43  physicist interrupted him with an impatient
 8  gesture.
 0  
45      "Consider... what would go on with all those
46  potential realities which have never come into
40  being because such-and-such decisions or
42  other such such-and-such decisions haven't
49  been taken? What happens to stations... if you'll
47  forgive an old man a paltry parable... which no
--------------------
46  'train of the present' has ever passed through
41  or will ever pass through in the future?"
 0  
39      Karl was now starting to see where the
47  conversation was going... and he didn't like it
41  one bit. Benedikt must have spotted this,
45  because he continued in a far livelier manner
39  and with a kind of morbid satisfaction.
 0  
43      "If what's happened is as you've described
48  it, then it means that reality was a creation of
50  well-nigh infinite complexity. It could be assumed
46  that a system of such great complexity doesn't
50  vanish all at once. Particularly when trillions of
48  similar creations are vanishing right alongside.
37  I think that, in this case, decay and
46  disappearance would require time. And that is,
--------------------
46  perhaps, what you can see... you're observing,
48  with a certain delay, the fact of the unbirth of
23  our version of reality.
 0  
45      "But..." Karl was barely able to choke out a
48  single word, "...in that case, why is it only me
45  who can see the degradation of the universe?"
 0  
42      "Who knows...?" The old man thought for a
43  moment. "It might have happened in that way
45  because it was one of your decisions that led
46  to the present heading along a different track
23  from the one we're on."
 0  
45      Aghast, Karl thought back to the day when it
46  had all begun. To the day when he'd decided to
41  give his relationship with Judith another
--------------------
45  chance. Now he could see what That Other Karl
44  had decided. He'd walked out. He'd left her.
 0  
43      He suddenly felt an extraordinary sense of
46  peace. He was finally done with fighting, with
44  running around in circles. He had long since
44  realised that his world had no _r_a_i_s_o_n _d___t_r_e
45  without Judith. He knew that, even though The
47  Other's world existed, without her, it would be
38  as empty and dark as the emptiness and
48  darkness that would soon fall here. 'It could be
39  said that, in a way, accounts have been
41  settled,' he thought, without a shadow of
46  emotion. Well, who knows, perhaps emotions had
22  ceased to exist, too? 
 0  
45      In the meantime, Benedikt was continuing his
--------------------
12  cogitations.
 0  
47      "It's not inconceivable that we're living in a
49  mirror image as the light is dying. In what might
49  have been... yet didn't happen. _I_n borrowed time.
46  Perhaps, indeed, the time has come to pay back
46  the loan. We think that we _a_r_e, yet, in truth,
44  we're merely after-images, the effect of the
47  universe's inertia. If that's the case, then we
43  won't even know when our universe ceases to
43  exist... And that could happen at any momen

-----------------CHAPTER-L----------------
38      The length of the bell rope was quite
46  impressive. Karl bound one end round his waist
48  and tied the other end firmly to a solitary tree
46  growing nearby. He stood above the dark abyss.
39  The few remaining stars twinkled at him
42  encouragingly. With a violent movement, he
47  thrust a hand into the abyss... and snatched it
48  back just as rapidly. He hadn't felt a thing, no
44  temperature difference at all. Still, he was
48  hesitant. He realised that the world was ending,
44  so it would be worth absorbing, in one last,
48  despairing gulp, the unfathomable knowledge that
42  his mind, for which time was most probably
48  running out, thirsted for. He also knew that, in
45  truth, the world had ended for him much, much
50  earlier... when he'd lost Judith. At that thought,
46  he felt a painful wrench in his chest. Without
--------------------
47  reflection, he leapt from the edge of Earth and
13  into space...
 0  
49      ...... but he didn't fall downwards. Even though
41  the prevailing temperature around him was
45  bearable and it was also possible to breathe,
49  Karl was floating in a weightless condition. 'Ah,
47  right,' he thought. 'Another law of physics has
44  vanished, too. Bearing in mind the nature of
43  what's happened in recent weeks, I won't be
47  surprised if I bang my fucking head on the dome
46  of the firmament.' The woodcut in Flammarion's
30  book had popped into his mind.
 0  
36      He turned round and looked at Earth
42  receding behind him. He had to admit that,
43  despite the appalling context, the view was
--------------------
49  incredible. There it was, spreading out from left
48  to right in the midst of the pitch-black void...
49  the world. No matter that it was almost deserted;
49  it was still visibly illuminated and covered with
47  vegetation; from this distance, it was possible
46  to make out the sparse scattering of buildings
40  and the people who'd survived meandering
45  between them without having even the foggiest
44  idea about the extraordinary phenomenon that
41  lay no more than a stone's throw away. To
43  simplify to a monstrous degree... it looked
44  rather like a panoramic photo of a landscape
46  mounted in the centre of a huge sheet of black
10  cardboard.
 0  
39      Then, suddenly, Karl noticed that more
45  sections of land were beginning to recede and
--------------------
41  vanish... and, as a result, the tree he'd
45  fastened the rope to had also disappeared and
47  the rope was now drifting slowly through space.
45  An animal terror swept through him. He thrust
48  desperately with all his limbs, as if he thought
39  that he could 'swim' back to Earth, and
47  instinctively started hauling himself along the
47  rope, still ludicrously expecting that, by some
46  miracle, this would bring him back to the edge
13  of the world.
 0  
46      Fear settled in his mind. He knew that, since
45  he was neither suffocating nor freezing, what
46  awaited him now were long days of dying in the
21  midst of nothingness.
 0  
40      Karl drifted away [A] into the boundless
--------------------
31  darkness and boundless despair.
