They made their way slowly through the town and Karl was dismayed as he assessed the extent of the decline in the structure of reality. There was almost no traffic. Pedestrians were a rarity. The buildings which still remained were intermittent. The district looked like the jaw of a man who’d been smacked hard in the face with an iron and lost every other tooth.* *

In order to distract himself and stop thinking about this, if only for a moment, Karl tackled a different topic.

“I sometimes wonder why you’re still single. If it isn’t a sensitive subject, that is? I know you’ve always got someone on the go, but never for good.”

Anton gave a lopsided smile and kicked a can lying on the street.

“I don’t know.” He hesitated. “N-o-o-o, that’s a barefaced lie. I know exactly why, but I don’t like splitting. Listen, love’s like the coccyx. It’s an atavism. An archaic, evolutionary vestige, not needed or noticed by anyone any more, and so... disappearing. It traces back to the times when a woman needed protecting, defending and security and that’s also why the tie between a woman and her partner-protector was indispensable. A tie that, in effect, also provided security to their issue and thus guaranteed the uninterrupted passing on of their genes.”

He spat on the asphalt. They walked on for a moment in silence. Finally, Anton took up the thread again.

“Doesn’t it seem to you that love’s grown shallower, that it’s contracted, become stunted? Vanished, like a superfluous organ, because women don't need protection any more... or, at any rate, that’s how it appears to them. Romantic feelings don’t really occur, while the commonplace human impulses of caring and nurturing that still remain here and there are simply met with animosity, prejudice or repugnance.”

Karl didn’t respond. He was musing over how diversely the same world could be perceived by different people.

They’d searched on the Internet and found a local group of devotees to the Mandela effect. The group’s activities were typical; meetings, lectures, film screenings and, of course, a lively presence on YouTube, as well. They had a rented room at their disposal and that very day they were giving an introductory talk for those new to the subject.

Karl and Anton came into the room and found a couple of seats. There was an audience of some dozen or so people in total and the presentation had already started. The speaker, a tall, skinny man with a shrill, squeaky voice, was holding forth.

“...and so, as you can see, the theory of which I am an adherent is primarily based on people... on the relationships between specific, living people who remember alternate facts, people who are witnesses to an alternate version of history, to a range of events... they are the walking proof of the fact that certain things occurred differently from what the official records say; they bore different names, they looked different and so forth. Someone or something introduces concrete changes into reality, sometimes major, sometime minor, but even though those changes evade the attention of most, there’s always a group of people who *do* notice. It might be that a parallel line of reality collides with ours. But it could be that someone deliberately interferes with our space-time, for example, as part of a scientific experiment. We suspect that the experiments carried out at the CERN laboratory are to blame. But one way or another, the upshot is that our reality gets mixed up with a parallel world, which causes some people to remember a version of the past that’s different from what everyone else recalls. Since you’re here today, in all likelihood most of you have noticed that some films have different scenes, or a different ending, that some products have different names, that the facts presented in the history books are out of kilter... to say nothing of the Bible.”

Once the talk was over and the audience was dispersing, the brothers managed to have a word with the skinny speaker.

“You are aware of how insane your story sounds, aren’t you?” their beanpole of a host squeaked.

‘Just look who’s talking,’ Karl thought, but he kept it to himself.

“I’m sorry, but I can’t help you,” the beanpole continued. “I don’t believe your theory. I don’t see any of the manifestations. Everything’s vanishing? Come on\! Everything’s just the same as always. N-o-o-o. What interests us are changes... geographical, factual, anatomical. Changes in nomenclature, in design, in film dialogues. Even if one recognises that a vanishing object also constitutes a kind of change... well, if it was a manifestation of the Mandela Effect, an entire group of people would unquestionably have noticed. That’s the crux of the matter.”

“Oh well, there we are. One way or another, it was worth giving it a try,” said Anton as they were leaving the building. “After listening to all that twaddle, I really can see that they’re actually involved in something that’s completely different from what brought us here. They’re two utterly different things. We’ll think about what to do next tomorrow.”

It was, indeed, now late, so they went their separate ways after \[Dagreeing to meet the following day\].
